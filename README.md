# LidarThesis
Code for research on feature detection and matching with Lidar
Using a BeagleBone Rev C for onboard processing and a Neato LDS for distance measurements.

Steps:
1. Rewrite the binary parser (done)
2. Plot the data in real time (in process)
3. Detect Lines with Hough Transform
4. Detect curves with Hough Transform
5. Merge scans by matching features
6. Integrate sensors into scan merging
7. Integrate sensors to adjust for movement in real time
